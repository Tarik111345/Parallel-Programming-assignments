In this document i provided screenshots for the tasks we had to do from the lab.


Task 1 - Cairo & hwloc (Hardware topology)

I use hwloc to see the computer's hadrware layout. The tool shows th CPU sockets, cores, threads, caches and memory tegions. The cairo library is used to draw the grapics.


Task 2 - Stream Benchmakr (Memory Bandwidth)

I run the STREAM Benchmark to measure memory bandwidh. The program performs operations copy scale add triad on large arrays to see the max data transfer rate.

Task 3 - Roofline Toolkit 

I tried to implement this task but i did not because it took a lot of time and I could wait. When i wanted to lower the FLOP count it didnt work and it just lowered the MP.


Task 4 - CloverLeaf Callgrind Profiling 

I used Callgrind to generate a call graph for the CloverLeaf program. It shows which parts of the code takes the most time, helping to knwo where to optimize.

Task 5 - likwid (Hardware counters)

Used likwid to check hardware counters like memory bandwidth and operational intensity. Helps to see how the CPU exectues the program.
